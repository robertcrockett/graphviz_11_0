# quoting Homebrew:
#
#   bison is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
#   because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
#   parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.
#
#   If you need to have bison first in your PATH, run:
#     echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/bison/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
#
#   For compilers to find bison you may need to set:
#     export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/bison/lib"
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/bison/bin:$PATH"
